 Of course. Here is a summary of our progress and the plan for the next session.

  Current Progress


  We have successfully set up the foundational structure of the MultiCamCollector application. Hereâ€™s a summary
  of what has been completed:


   * Project Scaffolding: The complete directory structure (gui, devices, services, models, utils) has been
     created.
   * Core Data Models: Frame and CaptureMetadata data classes are defined to ensure clean data handling.
   * Service Layer: Key services have been implemented with mock data:
       * DeviceManager to discover and manage cameras.
       * CaptureOrchestrator to handle the logic for synchronized frame capture.
       * StorageService to save images and metadata to disk with the specified directory structure
         (yyyyMMdd/lighting/background/seq_num).
   * GUI Implementation: A basic user interface has been built using PyQt6, including:
       * The main window with a defined layout.
       * Placeholders for the camera PreviewGrid.
       * A functional MetadataPanel for user input.
       * A LogPanel to display application messages.
   * Application Entrypoint: The main.py script is set up to assemble all components and launch the application.

  Next Steps

  Our immediate goal for the next session is to bring the application to a fully functional state with
  real-time data flow. The planned tasks are:


   1. Resolve Environment Issue: The top priority is to solve the ModuleNotFoundError for PyQt6. We need to ensure
      the Python interpreter running the script can access the installed packages.
   2. Implement Real-time Camera Previews:
       * Update the PreviewWidget to render actual RGB and Depth images.
       * Use background threads (QThread) to fetch frames continuously from the cameras without freezing the UI.
   3. Integrate Logging: Connect the loguru logging service to the LogPanel in the GUI so that status updates and
      errors are displayed in real-time.
   4. Refine UI and Functionality:
       * Implement the "Lock Metadata" feature to prevent accidental changes during a capture series.
       * Add the spacebar shortcut for the "Capture" button.
   5. Begin Real Camera Integration: Start replacing the MockCamera with actual implementations for the Intel
      RealSense (D435iCamera) and ZED (Zed2iCamera) cameras, integrating their respective SDKs.
