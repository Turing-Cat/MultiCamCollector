 Of course. Here is a summary of our progress and the plan for the next session.

Current Progress

We have successfully established the foundational structure and core components of the MultiCamCollector application, adhering to the architectural guidelines. Hereâ€™s a summary of what has been completed:

 * Project Scaffolding: The complete directory structure (gui, devices, services, models, utils) has been created, aligning with the defined layered architecture.
 * Core Data Models: Frame and CaptureMetadata data classes are defined, ensuring clean and type-hinted data handling.
 * Service Layer Implementation (with Mock Data): Key services have been implemented, initially utilizing mock data for development and testing:
     * DeviceManager: Capable of discovering and managing cameras.
     * CaptureOrchestrator: Handles the logic for synchronized frame capture.
     * StorageService: Manages saving images and metadata to disk, following the specified directory structure (yyyyMMdd/lighting/background/seq_num).
 * GUI Implementation (PyQt6): A basic yet functional user interface has been built, reflecting the design mockups:
     * The main window with a defined layout.
     * Placeholders for the camera PreviewGrid, ready for real-time rendering.
     * A functional MetadataPanel for user input, including lighting level, background ID, and sequence number.
     * A basic LogPanel to display application messages.
 * Application Entrypoint: The main.py script is set up to assemble all components and launch the application.
 * Documentation & Standards: Initial documentation (coding rules, dependencies, development flow, functional design) has been established, guiding the development process.

Next Steps

Our immediate goal for the next session is to bring the application to a fully functional state with real-time data flow and initial real camera integration. The planned tasks are:

 1. Resolve Environment Issue: The top priority is to solve the ModuleNotFoundError for PyQt6, ensuring the Python interpreter can access installed packages.
 2. Implement Real-time Camera Previews:
     * Update the PreviewWidget to render actual RGB and Depth images from camera streams.
     * Utilize background threads (QThread) to fetch frames continuously from the cameras without freezing the UI.
 3. Integrate Logging: Connect the loguru logging service to the LogPanel in the GUI for real-time status updates and error display.
 4. Refine UI and Functionality:
     * Implement the "Lock Metadata" feature to prevent accidental changes during a capture series.
     * Add the spacebar shortcut for the "Capture" button.
 5. Begin Real Camera Integration: Start replacing the MockCamera with actual implementations for the Intel RealSense (D435iCamera) and ZED (Zed2iCamera) cameras, integrating their respective SDKs.
