# Project Handover: MultiCamCollector Status

This document outlines the current state of the MultiCamCollector application and the remaining tasks for future development.

## Current Progress

The application is in a stable, functional state. The core architecture has been significantly refactored to ensure stability, and key features from the initial plan have been completed.

*   **Architecture & Stability:**
    *   The application has been refactored to a stable, thread-safe architecture. Each camera is managed by a dedicated background thread (`FrameWorker`), which prevents race conditions and SDK-level conflicts that were previously causing the application to crash.
    *   The `DeviceManager`'s separate monitoring thread was removed, as it was the source of the instability. The `FrameWorker`'s continuous operation now serves as a more robust and non-conflicting connection check.

*   **Device Integration & Synchronization:**
    *   **Real Camera Support:** The `DeviceManager` successfully discovers and connects to both Intel RealSense and ZED cameras. It gracefully falls back to mock cameras if no hardware is detected.
    *   **RGB-Depth Alignment:** Image alignment is active for both RealSense and ZED cameras, ensuring that the color and depth data are correctly matched.
    *   **Frame Synchronization:** A software-based synchronization is in place. The `CaptureOrchestrator` retrieves the most recent frame from each camera's dedicated worker thread, ensuring the collected frames are from approximately the same moment.

*   **GUI and User Experience:**
    *   **Data Saving Settings:** A `SettingsPanel` has been added to the UI, allowing the user to choose which data streams (RGB, Depth, Point Cloud) to save for each capture.
    *   **Capture Shortcut:** The spacebar now functions as a shortcut for the "Capture" button, improving workflow efficiency.
    *   **Layout:** The main window layout has been refined with splitters for better user customizability.

*   **Data & Persistence:**
    *   **Persistent Sequence Counter:** The `SequenceCounter` service correctly saves the sequence number to a file, allowing it to persist between application sessions.
    *   **Unicode Path Support:** The `StorageService` has been fixed to correctly save files to paths containing Unicode characters, resolving a critical bug on Windows systems.

## Next Steps & To-Do Items

The following tasks remain to bring the application to full feature completion.

1.  **Implement Point Cloud Generation & Saving:**
    *   The UI option to save point clouds exists, but the backend logic is currently a placeholder.
    *   **Task:** Implement a function to convert depth frames into 3D point clouds using the camera's intrinsic parameters. This will likely require extending the `AbstractCamera` interface to expose intrinsics.
    *   **Task:** Save the generated point clouds to disk, likely in the `.ply` format.

2.  **Enhance Logging System:**
    *   The current `LogPanel` is functional but basic.
    *   **Task:** Integrate a robust logging library like `loguru`.
    *   **Task:** Configure the logger to capture output from all services and direct it to both the console and the `LogPanel` in the UI. Implement color-coding for different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

3.  **Add Timestamp Validation for Synchronization:**
    *   The current frame synchronization relies on capturing the latest frames at the same time.
    *   **Task:** Enhance the `CaptureOrchestrator` to inspect the timestamps of the collected frames.
    *   **Task:** If the difference between timestamps exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., one frame duration), log a warning to alert the user of a potential synchronization issue.

4.  **Create Build & Distribution Package:**
    *   The project currently runs from source.
    *   **Task:** Create a `build.spec` file for PyInstaller.
    *   **Task:** Configure the build script to automatically include the necessary SDK libraries (e.g., `.dll` files for Windows) for both RealSense and ZED, ensuring the packaged application is self-contained and portable.

5.  **Improve Error Handling and UI Feedback:**
    *   The application is more stable, but UI feedback for errors can be improved.
    *   **Task:** If a camera disconnects, its `PreviewWidget` should clearly display a "Disconnected" or "Error" state instead of just freezing or showing the last valid frame. This can be handled in the `FrameWorker`.
